## Overview

Using two files on ride-sharing data by city type,  summary DataFrame will be built to help determine how data differs by city type. With the help of Pandas and Matplotlib, a line chart will be created to visualise the data, and help determine how difference in city types can be used by decision-markers at PyBer.
